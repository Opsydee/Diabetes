# Project Topic: "Predictive Modeling for Diabetes Progression Using Machine Learning"

# Project Overview: 
This project explores predictive modeling techniques for forecasting diabetes progression based on clinical features. The objective is to create a robust machine learning model that can predict future health conditions based on historical data using regression techniques. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and optimization.

# Installation and Setup:
- Create a virtual environment and activate it:
- Install the required packages:
     - import numpy as np
     - import pandas as pd 
     - from sklearn import datasets, linear_model
     - from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
     - from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
     - from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
     - from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error,r2_score

# Data (Source Data, Data Acquisition, Data Preprocessing):
- Source: The project uses the built-in diabetes dataset from Scikit-Learn.
- Acquisition: Data is programmatically loaded using: diabetes = datasets.load_diabetes()
- Preprocessing includes standardizing features and splitting data for model training and testing.
  
# Code Structure:
   - data_loading.py: Handles data import and exploration
   - model_training.py: Defines and trains the regression models
   - evaluation.py: Handles model evaluation and metrics reporting
   - utils.py: Utility functions
     
# Usage:
- Run the entire notebook sequentially to load data, preprocess, train, and evaluate the model.
- View performance metrics like Mean Squared Error and R-squared.

# Results and Evaluation:
The model achieves 51% on the test data, indicating its predictive performance for diabetes progression. Evaluation included cross-validation for model robustness.

# Future Work:
  - Integrate additional datasets for improved predictions
  - Explore advanced regression models (e.g., Ridge and Lasso Regression)
  - Deploy the model using Streamlit for user-friendly interaction
  - Perform hyperparameter tuning to enhance performance

# Acknowledgments:
